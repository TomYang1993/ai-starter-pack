name: ai-starter-pack
description: Set up a coding agent's everyday environment in one step — upstream-original terse-output style, prose cleanup, engineering skills, and optional tools such as rtk, CodeGraph, and Ponytail — written as portable files that work across Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Kilo Code, Antigravity, and any agent that follows the SKILL.md / AGENTS.md standard. Use this whenever the user says "set up my coding environment", "update my coding environment", "bootstrap my agent", "install my starter pack", "configure a new project for me", or starts working in a fresh repo or a freshly installed coding tool and wants their usual defaults in place. Also use when the user asks to add, list, update, or remove any of these components.

# AI Starter Pack

A self-installing pack. The agent reading this file **is** the installer — it uses
its own file tools and callable CLIs to perform the setup where the current host
expects it. User permission means: ask, then run the approved command or file
write yourself. Hand commands to the user only when no callable path exists or
the host requires an external approval/UI step the agent cannot operate.
Third-party skills/rules are installed from their upstream originals with their
license notices intact. Before installing or updating a component, fetch the
upstream README/docs for that component and follow the current upstream
instructions. Treat local repo checkouts as caches, not as the source of truth.
Do not use a local clone's README, install commands, or payload files just
because it exists on disk. Fetch upstream docs/payload directly from the remote
repo; if remote fetch is unavailable, stop and ask rather than silently falling
back to a local copy. Use local upstream checkouts only as hints for remotes or
existing user state unless the user explicitly requests offline/local-source
installation.
Optional tools such as rtk, CodeGraph, and Ponytail follow their upstream
installers and are never bundled.

The pack ships two kinds of content:

- **Collected upstream skills/rules** — original upstream skills such as
  `caveman`, `stop-slop`, and Matt Pocock's skill set, installed from upstream
  docs and copied as-is only when the upstream docs require file copying.

Some components are **not** pure skills. `rtk` is a compiled binary that
compresses shell output below the model, `codegraph` is a local CLI/MCP tool
that indexes projects for code-intelligence queries, and `ponytail` is an
upstream agent plugin/ruleset that reduces over-building. They are opt-in and
installed by following upstream docs, never bundled. See
`references/optional/rtk.md`, `references/optional/codegraph.md`, and
`references/optional/ponytail.md`.

## Run the install
> **Paths in this document are relative to this skill's location** — the folder
> or URL directory that contains this `SKILL.md` (e.g.
> `references/vendor/sources.json`, `LICENSES/...`). If this file was loaded
> from a raw GitHub URL, resolve relative references against the same repo and
> ref. Fetch only the referenced files you need.


Follow these steps in order. Do not skip the dedup checks — re-running this pack,
or running it on a machine that already has some of these files, must never create
duplicates or silently overwrite the user's edits. Resolve concrete install
targets only after the selected component's upstream docs or adapter have made
the target clear.

### 1. Detect the host

Default to the host/tool that is currently running this skill. Do **not** install
into other tools' directories just because they exist on disk. Only target
another host when the user explicitly names it (for example "set up Cursor too")
or sets `ASP_AGENT`.

Read `references/dedup.md` → "Host detection" and resolve `HOST` — the active
coding agent to configure.

If detection is ambiguous, ask the user which agent they want rather than
guessing. Honor `ASP_AGENT` when set.

Do not ask about "global" or "project" placement in this step. Placement makes
more sense after the user sees the curated component list and chooses what they
want.

### 2. Offer the menu

Present every component as available, then ask the user to choose the components
once up front. Do not silently install anything just because it is in the pack.
Keep the pitch natural and short: what it is, why it might help, its
popularity/quality signal, and what kind of permission or file change it needs.
Do not lead with placement jargon or ask for terse placement-prefixed replies.
The user is choosing capabilities first.

Before the checklist, give the user one short framing line so they understand the
two kinds of component and where each lands by default:

- **Pure skills** — `caveman`, `stop-slop`, `matt-pocock`. Recommended and
  default to **agent-side** for the detected `HOST` (installed into this agent's
  own skill area, reusable across all projects), unless the user later chooses
  project-level. These are broadly useful habits, so agent-side is the default.
- **Optional tools** — `rtk`, `codegraph`, `ponytail`. Infrastructure (binaries,
  MCP/hooks, plugins/rules); each follows its own upstream setup and asks before
  changing PATH, hooks, MCP, plugins, indexes, or rule files.

State this default once, here — do not resolve placement yet. The actual
agent-side vs project-level choice for the selected pure skills happens in
step 3.

If the host supports an interactive terminal picker, use a multi-select
checkbox UI where the user can move with arrow keys, toggle with Space, and
confirm with Enter. If the host only supports chat, show the same checkbox list
and ask the user to reply with names or numbers. Do not present component
selection as a Markdown table.

Suggested checklist copy:

```text
Choose what to install. Space toggles, Enter confirms.

[ ] caveman
    Very popular terse-output skill from Julius Brussee.
    Helps with shorter replies and less token waste.
    Impact: installs upstream skill behavior for this agent.

[ ] stop-slop
    Popular prose cleanup skill from Hardik Pandya.
    Helps remove obvious AI writing tells from docs, posts, and messages.
    Impact: installs upstream text skill and references.

[ ] matt-pocock
    Very popular production engineering skill set from Matt Pocock.
    Helps with TDD, debugging, planning, architecture review, and git workflow.
    Impact: follows upstream skills CLI; user can choose sub-skills or all.
    Special case: setup-matt-pocock-skills is a per-repo setup trigger.

[ ] rtk
    Popular shell-output compression tool from rtk-ai.
    Helps when terminal output burns too much context.
    Impact: may install a binary and per-host hooks.

[ ] codegraph
    Popular local code knowledge graph from Colby McHenry.
    Helps agents explore codebases with fewer search/read loops.
    Impact: may install CLI/MCP config and create a per-project .codegraph/.

[ ] ponytail
    Popular anti-overbuilding plugin/ruleset from Dietrich Gebert.
    Helps agents choose the smallest sufficient implementation.
    Impact: may install plugin hooks or rules depending on host.
```

If the user asks for "everything", preselect all components and ask for one
confirmation. Otherwise, show the checklist and let the user choose. Once the
selection is confirmed, say which components were selected. Then handle
placement for the selected pure skills in step 3 before installing in menu
order:

1. `caveman`
2. `stop-slop`
3. `matt-pocock`
4. `rtk`
5. `codegraph`
6. `ponytail`

Do not ask again whether to install a selected component. Pause only when user
action is actually needed: placement for selected pure skills in step 3,
permission to run a command, network/file-system access, a host-specific
approval screen, a duplicate/conflict decision, a `matt-pocock` sub-skill
choice, or an optional-tool setup choice from its adapter file.
Infrastructure items (`rtk`, `codegraph`, `ponytail`) still need explicit
permission at the moment they modify PATH, plugins, MCP/hooks, project indexes,
lifecycle hooks, or rule files.

When upstream instructions are written as slash commands, TUI actions, or
multiple prompts, do not assume the user must perform them. First look for the
host's callable CLI or shell equivalent, ask permission with the exact steps,
and run the approved steps in the required order. If no safe callable equivalent
exists, try an available UI automation/control tool when appropriate. Fall back
to guided manual steps only when the agent cannot run or operate the step; give
the user the exact command/action, wait for completion, then resume verification.

### 3. Explain placement for selected pure skills

If the user selected any pure skills (`caveman`, `stop-slop`, or
`matt-pocock`), explain placement now and resolve `SETUP_INTENT`.

Use user-facing terms first, with the raw scope words only as clarification:

- **Agent-side defaults** (recommended) — install into the current coding
  agent's own skill area, so the selected skills are available whenever the user
  uses this agent across projects. This is the default because these curated
  skills are broadly useful habits: terse output, prose cleanup, and production
  engineering workflows.
- **Project-level** — install inside the current repo/workspace, so the setup is
  limited to this project. Use this when the user wants the behavior to travel
  with a repo or avoid changing their general agent defaults.

Suggested wording:

```text
I recommend installing the selected pure skills as agent-side defaults for
<HOST>, because they are general-purpose habits that are useful across projects.
That means they live in <HOST>'s own skill area, not inside this repo.

If you want this setup confined to the current project instead, say project-level.
Otherwise I’ll use agent-side defaults for the pure skills and follow each
optional tool’s own setup prompts.
```

Treat "this repo/project/workspace" or "project-level" as `SETUP_INTENT=project`.
Treat "agent-side", "all projects", "everywhere", "global", "usual defaults", or
accepting the recommendation as `SETUP_INTENT=general`. If no pure skills were
selected, skip this step; optional tools use their own adapter-specific prompts.

### 4. Resolve upstream install plan and dedup BEFORE writing anything

If the tool can see multiple AI Starter Pack entrypoints (for example plugin plus
manual skill folder), use `references/dedup.md` → "Pack entrypoint duplicates"
before continuing. Use the single entrypoint when only one exists; when multiple
exist, choose the one tagged or described as recommended, otherwise choose the
first discovered entrypoint. Avoid installing another copy of the pack itself.

For every selected component:

1. Fetch and read that component's current upstream README/docs, or the
   component adapter named below.
2. Determine the concrete install method and target for the active `HOST` from
   those docs.
3. For pure skills, apply `SETUP_INTENT` after reading upstream (see step 3 and
   `references/dedup.md` → "Scope"). Be explicit when `general` means passing a
   tool flag such as `-g/--global` or choosing Global for an installer whose
   no-flag default is project-local.
4. Run the matching check in `references/dedup.md` → "Dedup checks" against the
   concrete target(s) the component will touch.

In summary:

- **Already installed by this pack** (our marker present, same version) → skip,
  report "already current".
- **Installed by this pack, older version** → show a diff, ask before replacing.
- **Installed independently by the user** (e.g. they already ran the upstream
  caveman installer) →
  do **not** write a second copy. Report what you found and ask whether to leave
  it, replace it, or merge.
- **Absent** → install.

Re-running is safe because the installer checks both ASP-owned installs and
user-owned installs before writing:

- ASP-owned installs carry the canonical metadata block defined in
  `references/update.md` → "Installed metadata"; legacy installs may carry only a
  `# source: ai-starter-pack <component> ...` line.
- User-owned installs usually do **not** have ASP metadata, so detect them by
  host location, folder name, `SKILL.md` frontmatter `name:`, upstream repo
  hints, and component-specific heuristics from `references/dedup.md`.
- Rule formats that need pack-specific names use `asp-<component>`.
- Skill-folder hosts normally keep the upstream skill name/folder, especially
  Kilo Code, where the folder name should match the `name:` in `SKILL.md`.
- If a likely user-owned equivalent exists, do not install another copy by
  default. Report what was found and ask whether to leave it, replace it, or
  keep both.

### 5. Write the selected components

- **caveman / stop-slop / matt-pocock** → only if explicitly chosen
  or included in the user's confirmed "usual" set. These have **no bundled
  rewritten payload**. Follow `references/vendor/VENDORING.md`: use
  `sources.json` for repo identity and hints, fetch the upstream README first,
  follow the upstream install instructions for the active `HOST`, and fetch only
  the exact payload files/folders plus LICENSE/NOTICE files needed for the
  selected component. If upstream provides an installer command for the active
  host, prefer that installer over hand-copying files. Pure skills default to
  agent-side placement because their content is reusable across projects; use
  project-level placement only when the user chose project setup or upstream
  offers no safe agent-side target. Optional tools (`rtk`, CodeGraph, Ponytail)
  are not pure skills and do not inherit this default. If the active host has no
  safe agent-side skill target, explain that and ask before falling back to
  project-level. Apply component-specific scope rules:
  - `caveman`: default to the active host's agent-side skill location when
    `SETUP_INTENT=general`, and tell the user before running commands if
    upstream may configure the active agent broadly. If `SETUP_INTENT=project`,
    use upstream project-level options when available; otherwise explain the
    broader impact and ask before continuing.
  - `stop-slop`: default to the active host's agent-side skill location when
    `SETUP_INTENT=general`; use project-level placement when
    `SETUP_INTENT=project`.
  - `matt-pocock`: the current upstream quickstart is the `skills` CLI. For
    `SETUP_INTENT=general`, say that ASP is intentionally using agent-side
    placement for reusable skills, then pass `-g/--global` or choose Global if
    the CLI asks. Install `setup-matt-pocock-skills` when upstream recommends
    selecting it, but do not run it during agent-side/defaults setup; tell the
    user it configures only the repo where it is invoked. For
    `SETUP_INTENT=project`, run the upstream command without `-g/--global`, let
    the CLI resolve host paths, choose Project if it asks for scope, and run or
    offer `setup-matt-pocock-skills` only when the user wants the current repo
    configured.
  For any pure-skill component, stop and ask if no fetch/install tool is
  available or the upstream README is unclear.
- **rtk / codegraph / ponytail** → only if explicitly chosen. Each is optional
  infrastructure, not a pure skill; follow its adapter file exactly —
  `references/optional/rtk.md`, `references/optional/codegraph.md`,
  `references/optional/ponytail.md`. The adapter owns the full flow (reuse an
  existing binary/install, fetch the upstream README only when
  install/update/repair is needed, narrate, verify, report) and the permission
  gates before touching PATH, hooks, plugins, MCP config, agent permissions,
  project indexes, modes, or rule files.

### 6. Report

Summarize per component: installed / skipped (already current) / skipped (user
already had it) / updated. Tell the user the trigger phrases for the on-demand
skills. Do not re-read or narrate these instructions back to the user.

## Provenance and licensing

Do not summarize, rewrite, or clone well-known community skills into ASP-branded
payloads. For collected third-party components, use the remote upstream
README/docs as the source of truth, fetch only the selected remote upstream
payload files when needed, and preserve license/notice files. This pack's own
MIT content is limited to installer glue and documentation.

## Adding, listing, updating, removing

- **list** → scan `SKILLS_DIR` for ASP-managed metadata/markers, legacy `asp-*`
  folders, and optional tool status; report what's present and at what version.
- **add** → run steps 1–6 for just the named component.
- **update** → read `references/update.md` and follow its ownership rules. Only
  update AI Starter Pack-managed components that are unchanged or explicitly
  approved. Never overwrite user-edited, user-updated, or user-added skills by
  default.
- **remove** → delete only the matching ASP-managed folder/rule, including
  legacy `asp-<name>` installs, or follow the optional tool's uninstall notes.
  Never touch unrelated user content.
